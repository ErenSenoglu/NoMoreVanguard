# FuckVanguard

A simple script to completely disable and re-enable the Vanguard Anti-Cheat when it is not in use.

- *Easy to use*
- *Simple and readable script*
- *Works quickly*
- *Automatic setup*
- *Updated Frequently*

Future Plans:
- ~~Create catch for script to detect when there are multiples instances of Vanguard after an update~~
- Make script automatically run when Valorant launches/closes
- Keep project FOSS
